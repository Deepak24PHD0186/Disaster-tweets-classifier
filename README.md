# disaster-tweet-classifier
A classifier that detects real disaster tweets using NLP

# ðŸ§  Disaster Tweet Classifier

This project is a submission for the Kaggle competition [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). The goal is to classify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains 10,000+ tweets labeled as:
- `1` - tweet refers to a **real disaster**
- `0` - tweet is **not** about a real disaster

Provided by Kaggle:
- [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)
- [test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)
- [sample_submission.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing

- Lowercased text
- Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, numbers
- Tokenization & TF-IDF vectorization

---

## ðŸ¤– Model

We used **Logistic Regression** with TF-IDF features as a baseline model.

### Evaluation Metric
The competition uses the **F1 Score** as the primary evaluation metric.

### Validation Score
Achieved a validation F1 score of **`{0.7085}`**.
